# GJU Web Scraper (Selenium-Based)

This repository contains a full web scraping pipeline built to extract, clean, and chunk textual content from the official German Jordanian University (GJU) website.

The scraper was created as part of a university RAG Chatbot project — where collected data will later be transformed into embeddings and stored in a vector database.



## 🚀 Features

- Scrapes any list of URLs using **Selenium**
- Automatically detects the main content area of each page
- Extracts text while ignoring navigation bars, sidebars, and menus
- Splits long pages into fixed-size chunks (260 words with 50-word overlap)
- Saves all results to a clean CSV file
- URLs are loaded from an external CSV file (`urls.csv`)
- Output is ready for **Embeddings → Vector DB → Retriever → RAG Chatbot**
